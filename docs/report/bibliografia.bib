abstract = "A general problem in model selection is to obtain the right
parameters that make a model fit observed data. For a multilayer perceptron
(MLP) trained with back-propagation (BP), this means finding appropiate layer
size and initial weights. This paper proposes a method (G-Prop, genetic
backpropagation) that attempts to solve that problem by combining a genetic
algorithm (GA) and BP to train MLPs with a single hidden layer. The GA selects
the initial weights and changes the number of neurons in the hidden layer
through the application of specific genetic operators. G-Prop combines the
advantages of the global search performed by the GA over the MLP parameter space
and the local search of the BP algorithm. The application of the G-Prop
algorithm to several real-world and benchmark problems shows that MLPs evolved
using G-Prop are smaller and achieve a higher level of generalization than other
perceptron training algorithms, such as Quick-Propagation or RPROP, and other
evolutive algorithms, such as G-LVQ."
